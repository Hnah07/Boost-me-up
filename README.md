# Boost Me Up 🚀

**Boost Me Up** is a stylish and intuitive web app that helps users build self-confidence by celebrating small wins and daily positive moments.

Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Framer Motion**, and powered by a **MongoDB backend**, this app is designed to feel good, look good, and *be* good — across all devices.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

This was a passion project where I explored the idea:  
**"What if a journal could visually cheer you on?"**  
Instead of being just another task list, Boost Me Up feels ambient, motivational — like a warm hug from your past self.

## 🧪 AI Collaboration

This project was co-developed with the assistance of **Claude**, an AI assistant. I guided the development, made architectural decisions, and implemented the full codebase. AI was used for brainstorming UI/UX ideas and code suggestions.
